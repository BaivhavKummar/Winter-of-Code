    <h1>What I'm Looking For</h1>
    <p>I'm searching for a lovely lady cat who:</p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knows how to appreciate a good nap and doesn't mind sharing the bed.</li>
            <li>Will indulge me with extra treats when no one is looking</li>
            <li>Enjoyes long strolls around the living room (sometimes)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

        <ul>
        
  
        <li>Can tolerate me sitting on top of the fridge to keep an eye on things</li>
        
     
        
        </ul>
      
        
        <h2>How to Get in TouchüòΩ</h2>
        
        <p>If you're interested, simple send a note through the litter box system(aka your human's phone) or come find me in kitchen at 3 AM I'll be the one loudly meowing for no reason.</p>
        
        <p>P.S. I'm not looking for just any cat. I need a partner who can handle my <strong>purrfectly I
        
        ridiculous antics</strong>1</p>
        
        
        <h2>Why Marry Me?üòª</h2>
        <p>Because I can promise you: </p>
        <ul>
        <li>Unlimited supply of fur everywhere</li>
        <li>A lifetime of chasing shadows and getting stuck in cardboard boxes</li>
        
        <li>Countless hours of me ignoring you while you pet me</li>
        
        <li>Some day, I'll let you be the one who opens the tuna can (but dont't count on it)</li>
        
        </ul><br>
